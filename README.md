# Pre-Processing-Hyperspectral-Images

The Algorithms are carried out on the Hyperspectral Image, Hawaii.raw. 

The different band re-ordering algorithms that are implemented,

- Greedy Ordering Algorithm
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort

In each algorithm the different scanning techniques that are implemented,

- Raster
- ZigZag
- Orthogonal
- Snake

The scanned list so obtained is subjected to Huffman Coding and compression ratio is calculated.

The Structural Similarity Index is also implemented and compared with Correlation Coefficient.

Further, Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) is implemented for each band re-ordering algorithm and the obtained result is given as input to Huffman Coding.
